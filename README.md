# Flashcard Capstone Project

## Overview
The Flashcard Capstone Project is an interactive application designed to help users enhance their learning experience through digital flashcards. Users can review and track their progress by marking known words, making it easier to reinforce their knowledge on various topics.

## Features
- Displays random flashcards with words in French and their English translations.
- Users can indicate if they know a word, removing it from future review sessions.
- The progress is saved, so known words wonâ€™t appear in future sessions.
- Automatically flips the flashcard after a few seconds to reveal the translation.
